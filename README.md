# Volume Data Year over Year

For this project the objective was to identify how volume had changed year over year from Q2 2020 to Q2 2021.

Here is the original request...

"The board is asking to see how volume looked in Q2. I got some data (attached), but didn’t have a chance to pull anything together and was hoping you could take a stab at it.

I think they just want to see Q2 2021 volume by region and wanted to know if everything was looking good. I think this file has what you need. I don’t remember all the region codes – I know NAM ends in 1, EMEA ends in 3 and APAC and LATAM are 2 and 4, but I don’t remember which is which. I do know LATAM has the lowest volume so just go ahead and assign that to which ever comes out lowest."

## Ask
To start off it was important to clarify the objective and set clear goals for the project.

The goal was to find volume by region and compare Year over Year to determine if Q2 2021 is looking good.

## Prepare
The data tables were not to big for EXCEL.  There were 2 tables, one for Volume Data and another for GEO Data.  Region codes were not attached to clients, but the GEO codes will help determine Region according to the original request.

## Process
Client ID, Region Codes, Dates/Quarters

## Analyze
